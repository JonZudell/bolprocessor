Here is a short list of known issues since I began working on the project:

- Level 3 & 4 optimization in CWpro4 seem to be breaking some things.  Most
noticeably, selecting "New Project" causes an infinite loop in setting the
Midi output port?

- Can't successfully run +sc.checkall because -gr.Visser3 fails on these
lines of code in FillPhaseDiagram.c (line 902):
		if(nseq >= Minconc) {
			if(Beta) {
				Alert1("Err. FillPhaseDiagram(). nseq >= Minconc");
				goto ENDDIAGRAM;
				}

- Several "variable used before initialized" warnings should be investigated.
