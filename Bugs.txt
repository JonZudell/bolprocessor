Here is a short list of known issues since I began working on the project:

- Level 3 & 4 optimization in CWpro4 seem to be breaking some things.  Most
noticeably, selecting "New Project" causes an infinite loop in setting the
Midi output port?

- Can't successfully run +sc.checkall because -gr.Visser3 fails on these
lines of code in FillPhaseDiagram.c (line 902):
		if(nseq >= Minconc) {
			if(Beta) {
				Alert1("Err. FillPhaseDiagram(). nseq >= Minconc");
				goto ENDDIAGRAM;
				}

- Several "variable used before initialized" warnings should be investigated.

- These dialogs cannot be closed with Command-W: Tuning, Default performance
values, Default strike mode, and File Save Preferences.

- importing a long Csound score into a sound-prototype (with large time values)
results in a lot of "overflow" messages in the Trace window.  Pressing Command-.
during this output brings up the Resume/Stop dialog and choosing Stop then 
_starts_ a silent performance for a length of time. (Equal to last performance 
length?) ??

- I had a fatal system crash ("bomb" dialog) while using the sound prototypes
window.  First, opened prototypes, then added some names to an alphabet.  Then
did search and replace on alphabet names.  Closed alphabet window, no save, 
then said no when it asked me to load -mi file, then trying to browse through
prototypes caused a crash.

- Are MIDIfileOpened and other related globals being reset after deleting an
aborted file write?

- FlushVolume() seems wrong; could just use FlushVol from Toolbox instead.
