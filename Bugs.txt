Here is a short list of known issues since I began working on the project:

- Level 3 & 4 optimization in CWpro4 seem to be breaking some things.  Most
noticeably, selecting "New Project" causes an infinite loop in setting the
Midi output port?

- Can't successfully run +sc.checkall because -gr.Visser3 fails on these
lines of code in FillPhaseDiagram.c (line 902):
		if(nseq >= Minconc) {
			if(Beta) {
				Alert1("Err. FillPhaseDiagram(). nseq >= Minconc");
				goto ENDDIAGRAM;
				}

- Several "variable used before initialized" warnings should be investigated.

- These dialogs cannot be closed with Command-W: Tuning, Default performance
values, Default strike mode, and File Save Preferences.

- importing a long Csound score into a sound-prototype (with large time values)
results in a lot of "overflow" messages in the Trace window.  Pressing Command-.
during this output brings up the Resume/Stop dialog and choosing Stop then 
_starts_ a silent performance for a length of time. (Equal to last performance 
length?) ??
