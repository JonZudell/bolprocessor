Here is a short list of known issues since I began working on the project:

- Level 3 & 4 optimization in CWpro4 seem to be breaking some things.  Most
noticeably, selecting "New Project" causes an infinite loop in setting the
Midi output port?

- Can't successfully run +sc.checkall because -gr.Visser3 fails on these
lines of code in FillPhaseDiagram.c (line 902):
		if(nseq >= Minconc) {
			if(Beta) {
				Alert1("Err. FillPhaseDiagram(). nseq >= Minconc");
				goto ENDDIAGRAM;
				}

- Several "variable used before initialized" warnings should be investigated.

- These dialogs cannot be closed with Command-W: Tuning, Default performance
values, Default strike mode, and File Save Preferences.

- importing a long Csound score into a sound-prototype (with large time values)
results in a lot of "overflow" messages in the Trace window.  Pressing Command-.
during this output brings up the Resume/Stop dialog and choosing Stop then 
_starts_ a silent performance for a length of time. (Equal to last performance 
length?) ??

- I had a fatal system crash ("bomb" dialog) while using the sound prototypes
window.  First, opened prototypes, then added some names to an alphabet.  Then
did search and replace on alphabet names.  Closed alphabet window, no save, 
then said no when it asked me to load -mi file, then trying to browse through
prototypes caused a crash.

- Are MIDIfileOpened and other related globals being reset after deleting an
aborted file write?

- FlushVolume() seems wrong; could just use FlushVol from Toolbox instead.

- In TextEdit build, window updates redraw the text from the top of the document
instead of the current scroll position.

- Crashes if too much text is inserted into a TextEdit buffer.

- Getting warnings about using temporary memory and running out of memory with
the Carbon build, even running on OS X, after producing items several times 
with a complex project.

- BP2 crashes if you press the "Piano roll" button in the Object prototypes
window several times in a row.  (tries to dispose of several empty handles
in MakeSound() first).

- Not sure about the source of this one.  Had a memory access exception (OS X)
clicking the close box of wPrototype1.  Details below:

	Had loaded -ho.abc1 & -mi.abc1, then loaded -gr.koto3 to try and test 
	-in.abc1.  After browsing the prototypes (playing a few of them by 
	themselves), I tried to close the prototype window.
	
	Stack trace:
		GoAway() - line 939:	wmem = 26 (wPrototype1)  w = 17 (wBufferSize)
		BPActivateWindow() - line 1014:   Nw = 26 (wPrototype1)
		GetDialogValues(force = YES) - last line (342):  iProto = 2
		CheckConsistency(j = 2, check = TRUE) - line 450:  longerCsound = 0
		SetPrototypeDuration(j = 2) - line 1051
		DurationToPoint(pp_MIDIcode,NULL,p_MIDIsize,j = 2) - line 768
		
	in DurationToPoint (line 766):
		if(pp_midicode != NULL) {
			for(i=0,time = ZERO; i < (*p_size)[j]; i++) {
				time += (*((*pp_midicode)[j]))[i].time;
				(*((*pp_midicode)[j]))[i].time = time;
				}
				
		(*pp_midicode)[0] is NULL (to be expected, I think)
		(*pp_midicode)[1] is not NULL and points to MIDIcodes with 
			the first two bytes = 248 * 0.
		(*pp_midicode)[2 thru 35] are all NULL.
		
		But Jbol is 19, and several of these prototypes are supposed
		to contain MIDI data, so this does not seem correct.
		
		(*p_size)[0 and 1] are 0 (to be expected, I think)
		(*p_size)[2 thru 18] are 28,6,30,12,75,6,1,32,0,0,6,0,0,0,36,6,6
		
		So, it seems to me that many of the MIDIcode arrays are NULL but
		are supposed to contain data.
		
		(*p_Bol)[0 thru 18] are _, -, chik, a, a', b, b', c, c', d, d', e,
			f, f', g, g', cycle1, sync, cycle2
		

- Colored text displays as black on OS X.

- TEToScrap() does not work on OS X; Cut and Copy commands may not work
correctly all of the time (especially to/from other apps).

- Auto-scrolling in text windows (by dragging beyond the current view rect)
does not move the scroll bar.  (TE only?)

- TE windows do not always display all text in the same font size.
