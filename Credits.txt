Version 2.9.3 of Bol Processor has been developed thanks to feedback and cooperation of several musicians and computer scientists.

Among them:

Harm Visser and Thierry Montaudon have been in contact with the designers for several months, using BP2 to compose music in Western contemporary style.  This prompted the development of tools enhancing the syntactic model.  See their musical examples in the folder on contemporary Western music and in the "NEW EXAMPLES" folder.

Thanks to Jim Ross, Tom Demeyer, Nadaka and Didier, Paul Sheldon, Sterling Beckwith for comments, code examples, help in uploading and distributing.  To Otto Laske and Jim Kippen for supporting the underlying research work.  To Barry Vercoe for encouraging work with Csound.  And to the GMEB folks in Bourges for their 1997 award...

Internet newsgroups for Mac software developers such as the CSMP compilation are great help to us.

Last but not least, EvangeListas keep the spirits high broadcasting news about the impressive development of MacOS and Rhapsody.
