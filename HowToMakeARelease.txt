Making a BP2 Release
--------------------

This is how I go about making a Bol Processor release.  Not every step here
is required, but I think that it works nicely to do it this way.

Once you think you have the code in a state that should be built and
publicly released, you will need to update the version number of the
application and some other values in several places:


1.	First, check that the list of contributors and the copyright years are
	up-to-date in License.txt.


2.	Edit the values for the following keys in file resources/Info.plist:

	a.  CFBundleGetInfoString can be set to a long version string like this 
		
			Bol Processor BP2 - Carbon 2.9.7 beta
	
	b.	CFBundleShortVersionString, and CFBundleVersion should both be set
		to the version number only.  Something like
		
			2.9.8
			2.9.7 beta
	
	c.  Update the copyright years in key NSHumanReadableCopyright.
	
	Note that the name of the executable should no longer be changed to
	include the version number.  Changing the name can cause problems with
	AppleScript.

When BP2 was built with CodeWarrior, it was necessary to modify the version
numbers in these two files instead of resources/Info.plist:

	resources/BP2-MacOS.rsrc  (now resources/decoded_resources/BP2-MacOS.rsrc)
	resources/plst-resource.plc
	
If I remember correctly, the .plc was used only by CodeWarrior and to
generate an Info.plist file.  The file BP2-MacOS.rsrc is still used by the
XCode project, but the 'vers' #1 resource seems to be ignored by the Finder
when the Info.plist file is present.  Editing the .rsrc files is not as easy
anymore since ResEdit cannot be run on 10.5 or later.  The only downloadable
OS X software that I have found for this purpose is called ResFool.  I think
updating the 'vers' #1 resource is unnecessary now that BP2 is no longer
being built for Mac OS Classic.


3.	Update BP2's internal list of version numbers.

	a.	Near the top of the file source/BP2/-BP2.h, there are two constants
		that must be changed:
	
		SHORT_VERSION		Set to the version number only (eg. "2.9.7 beta")
		MAXVERSION			Increase by 1; should = size of VersionName[]
		
		IDSTRING			This should be left alone.
		
	b.	In the file source/BP2/-BP2main.h, add a new string to the end of
		the array VersionName[] for the new version.  This string is written
		into BP2 files and checked for compatibility when opening a file. 
		These strings should not contain spaces (eg. "BP2.9.8").  Also, the
		strings in the array should remain in release order because their
		indices are compared to determine compatibility.

		char VersionName[][VERSIONLENGTH] = {"-","V.2.1","V.2.2","V.2.3",
			"V.2.4","V.2.5","V.2.5.1","V.2.5.2","V.2.6","BP2.6.1","BP2.6.2",
			"BP2.6.3","BP2.7","BP2.7.1","BP2.7.2","BP2.7.3","BP2.7.4",
			"BP2.8.0","BP2.8.1","BP2.9.0","BP2.9.1","BP2.9.2","BP2.9.3",
			"BP2.9.4", "BP2.9.5", "BP2.9.6beta", "BP2.9.6", "BP2.9.7beta", 
			"BP2.9.8"};

	c.	Also near the top of source/BP2/-BP2main.h, update the global
		variable Version to the index of the current version in
		VersionName[] (this will be one less than MAXVERSION in any
		circumstance that I can imagine):
	
		int Version = 28; /* 2.9.8 */


4.	Rebuild BP2 and check that the correct version number is reported in the
	following places:
	
	- the Finder "Get Info" window
	- the Finder folder containing the app when set to "list view"
	- the BP2 startup messages
	- the BP2 "About" dialog
	- a newly saved BP2 file


5.	Update the version number and details of the release documents and the
	source code ReadMe:

	docs-release/Known Issues.rtf
	docs-release/Recent Changes.rtf
	docs-release/ReadMe-beta.rtf
	docs-release/ReadMe.rtf
	ReadMe.txt


6.	Update these other project documentation files if necessary:

	BP2 help
	Bugs.txt
	Credits.txt
	HowToBuild.txt
	MakingARelease.txt
	

7.	Commit all of these changes to CVS.


8.	Tag all of the sources in CVS so that they can be referenced later.

I usually include both the bolprocessor and the QAVAID modules in the source
releases, so I tag both which means I have to have the QAVAID module checked
out.  Use this command from the parent directory where bolprocessor/
resides:

	cvs -z3 -d:ext:akozar@bolprocessor.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bolprocessor co -P QAVAID

Then tag with these commands (replacing THE_TAG with the new tag):

	cd bolprocessor/
	cvs tag -c THE_TAG

	cd ../QAVAID/
	cvs tag -c THE_TAG
	
These are the existing tags in the repository:
		BP-295-final
		BP-296-final
		BP-297-beta
		BP-298-final


9.	Create a new directory for the release sources and export the tagged files.

The CVS export command is used to get the release sources instead of
checkout because it does not create all of the "CVS" directories.  I usually
name the directory after the CVS tag that I used above, but any meaningful
name is fine.

	mkdir THE_TAG-source
	cd THE_TAG-source
	
	cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@bolprocessor.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bolprocessor export -r THE_TAG bolprocessor
	
	cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@bolprocessor.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bolprocessor export -r THE_TAG QAVAID

	cp bolprocessor/ReadMe.txt bolprocessor/License.txt ./
	
(The last command creates copies of the ReadMe and License in the top folder)


10.	Create a source tarball (to encourage non-Mac developers)

	cd ..
	tar -cvzf THE_TAG-source.tgz THE_TAG-source/
	

11.	Decode the resource files:

	cd THE_TAG-source/bolprocessor/resources/
	./decodersrcs.sh


12.	Create a source disk image (.dmg) for Mac users.

In the OS X Disk Utility application, choose "New" -> "Disk Image from
Folder" and select the source directory that you created in step 9.  Choose
"compressed" from the "Image Format" pop-up (it will be read-only too).  I
name this file

		BP-[version]-source.dmg

I create the source code archives before building so that I do not have to
remove the build output files.


13.	Open the current XCode project, select the default target and the
	"Release" build configuration and build "Bol Processor.app".

If anything goes wrong at this point, you probably tagged the wrong sources
or didn't commit something to the repository.  Fix the problem in your
original CVS working directory and go back to step 7. ("Do not pass GO; Do
not collect $100!") :(


14.	Assemble the application release folder.

Create a new folder named "Bol Processor [version]" to put all of the release
files into.  Here are the contents of this folder as I usually assemble it:

	Bol Processor.app
	BP2 Docs and Examples
		BP2 documentation.html  (alias to BP2-DOC-HTML/-BP2 documentation.html)
		License.txt
		BP2-DOC-HTML			(folder containing the HTML manual)
		Credits.txt
		Bol Processor site		(URL file: http://bolprocessor.sourceforge.net/)
		bol-processor-data		(the set of examples distributed with releases)
	ReadMe.rtf
	Recent Changes.rtf
	Known Issues.rtf

The RTF documents are copied from the docs-release/ directory.  I usually
just copy the entire folder "BP2 Docs and Examples" from the previous
release because so far the manual and examples have not changed.  Note that
the set of examples here is organized differently than in CVS and the files
all have the correct BP2 creator and file types so that they will open
properly in Bol Processor.  The License.txt and Credits.txt files should be
updated if they have changed.

To make everything look "professional", I arrange the icons nicely and
configure the Finder view options (such as "always open in icon view") so
that the view will hopefully look the same on the disk image.


15.	Create the application disk image (.dmg).

Make a disk image of the application release folder, "Bol Processor [version]",
in the same way that you did for the source release in step 12.  I name this
file

		BP-[version]-OSX.dmg


16.	Upload all three archives to the Sourceforge File Release system.

It is a good idea to create a "release notes" document and add it to the
file release folder on Sourceforge with the name "README.txt".  Sourceforge
will automatically display this file below the downloads.  You can also use
this file as the basis for email announcements.
	
Information that I include in the release notes:

	Version number
	Release date
	List of files released and a very short description of each file's contents
	List of important changes since the last release

Here is an example of the file list for version 2.9.7 beta:

	BP-2.9.7-beta-OSX.dmg         Application for Mac OS X 10.4 or later
	BP-2.9.7-beta-source.dmg      Source code for Mac OS X
	BP-2.9.7-beta-source.tgz      Source code for porting to other OSes


17.	Update the web site at http://bolprocessor.sourceforge.net/

	a. Add a "news" item about the release.
	b. Add links in the "Downloads" section to the file releases.


18.	Send an email announcement to the BP2 mailing lists:

	bp2-list@yahoogroups.com
	bolprocessor-announce@lists.sourceforge.net
	bolprocessor-devel@lists.sourceforge.net


19.	Go to sleep, because it is probably 6:00am !!  ;-)
