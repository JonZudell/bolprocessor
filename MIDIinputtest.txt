"MIDIinputtest" is a minimum program written in C language to check receiving MIDI messages (e.g. from a piano keyboard) and forwarding them immediately to the first available MIDI device (e.g. a synthesizer).

It also displays the channel, note and velocity of incoming NoteOn/Off messages. You can therefore use it without an output MIDI device.

You should try this program after trying "MIDItest" which only checks real-time MIDI output.

Compile the "MIDIinputtest.c" code, then run the "MIDIinputtest" program. Below are the compile commands. The -Wall and -Wextra options show any warnings that suggest improvements to the code.

// MacOS (Link with CoreMIDI libraries)
gcc MIDIinputtest.c -o MIDIinputtest -framework CoreMIDI -framework CoreFoundation -Wall -Wextra

// Linux (Link with ALSA libraries)
// You may need to install the ALSA libraries:
sudo apt install libasound2-dev
// Then compile:
gcc MIDIinputtest.c -o MIDIinputtest -lasound -Wall -Wextra

// Windows (Link with WinMM libraries)
// Use this after installing MinGW 64-bits (https://bolprocessor.org/install-mingw/)
// The _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS option ignores the security warnings about fopen() and fscanf()

gcc -o MIDIinputtest.exe MIDIinputtest.c -lwinmm -D_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS -Wall -Wextra


=====  Running MIDIinputtest =====

// Switch on your MIDI devices (input + output) and run the "MIDIinputtest" program:
./MIDIinputtest (in MacOS)
MIDIinputtest.exe (in Windows)
MIDIinputtest (in Linux)

If you hear nothing and/or see nothing, make sure that:
1) Your MIDI devices are switched on (and hooked to IAC on Mac)
2) The numbers MIDIsource and MIDIoutput at the top of MIDIinputtest.c are the ones displayed at startup when MIDIinputtest is scanning the list of available devices.

Please send your suggestions or modified "MIDIinputtest.c" files to:
