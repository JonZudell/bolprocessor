"MIDItest" is a minimum program written in C language to check the real-time output of MIDI events.

The program will read a list of MIDI events (only NoteOn/NoteOff) from the file "MIDItest-list.txt" and send them to your MIDI outpout device (e.g. a synthesizer). Timings will be correct because it has an in-built event scheduler.
Therefore, the output MIDI messages do not need to be time-stamped. This is good news because most devices do not handle time-stamped events.

Compile the "MIDItest.c" code, then run the "MIDItest" program. Below are the compile commands.

// MacOS (Link with CoreMIDI libraries)
gcc MIDItest.c -o MIDItest -framework CoreMIDI -framework CoreFoundation

// Linux (Link with ALSA libraries)
gcc MIDItest.c -o MIDItest -lasound

// Windows (Link with WinMM libraries)
// Maybe Visual Studio will compile it more easily. Put _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS in preprocessor settings because it does not like fopen() and fscanf()!
// Otherwise, install MinGW-w64 and run the following gcc command:

gcc -o MIDItest.exe MIDItest.c -lwinmm -D_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS

=====  Running MIDItest =====

// Switch on your MIDI device and run the "MIDItest" program:
./MIDItest (in MacOS)
MIDItest (in Windows)
