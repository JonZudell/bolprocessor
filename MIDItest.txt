"MIDItest" is a minimum program written in C language to check the real-time output of MIDI events.

The program will read a list of MIDI events (only NoteOn/NoteOff) from the file "MIDItest-list.txt" and send them to your MIDI outpout device (e.g. a synthesizer). Timings will be correct because it has an in-built event scheduler. So, MIDI messages do not need to be time-stamped.

Compile the "MIDItest.c" code, then run the "MIDItest" program. Below are the compile commands.

// MacOS (Link with CoreMIDI libraries)
gcc MIDItest.c -o MIDItest -framework CoreMIDI -framework CoreFoundation

// Linux (Link with ALSA libraries)
gcc MIDItest.c -o MIDItest -lasound

// Windows (Link with WinMM libraries)
gcc -o MIDItest.exe MIDItest.c -lwinmm

// Switch on your MIDI device and run the "MIDItest" program:
./MIDItest (in MacOS)
MIDItest (in Windows)

Please send back your modified "MIDItest.c" code file to:
