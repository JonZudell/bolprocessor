short CurrentVref
long CurrentDir
int ScriptW,CurrentChannel;

These are only used by running scripts (or when setting up to run a script).
CurrentDir/Vref are used to make specs for loading files.


short LastVref
long LastDir

These are initialized to BP2's startup folder, and afterwards updated everytime
that MyOpen() opens a file, but they are never used for anything.  (Could be
used to set the default folder for open/save dialogs).


int OkWait

Usually TRUE but set FALSE by the "Prompt OFF" script command.  WaitForNoteOn(),
WaitForTags(), and WaitKeyStrokeOrAppleEvent() will not run if this is set to
FALSE and MakeSound() will not wait for a "synchronized start" if FALSE. 
Answer() will return its default choice when (AEventOn && !OkWait).  This could
be a good mechanism to prevent user interaction in console/library build (??)
but notes that OkWait is also frequently reset to TRUE or 'OK' at the end of
processes.  (A console option could reenable?)
