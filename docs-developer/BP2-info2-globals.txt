short CurrentVref
long CurrentDir
int ScriptW,CurrentChannel;

These are only used by running scripts (or when setting up to run a script).
CurrentDir/Vref are used to make specs for loading files.


short LastVref
long LastDir

These are initialized to BP2's startup folder, and afterwards updated everytime
that MyOpen() opens a file, but they are never used for anything.  (Could be
used to set the default folder for open/save dialogs).
