short CurrentVref
long CurrentDir
int ScriptW,CurrentChannel;

These are only used by running scripts (or when setting up to run a script).
CurrentDir/Vref are used to make specs for loading files.


short LastVref
long LastDir

These are initialized to BP2's startup folder, and afterwards updated everytime
that MyOpen() opens a file, but they are never used for anything.  (Could be
used to set the default folder for open/save dialogs).


int OkWait

Usually TRUE but set FALSE by the "Prompt OFF" script command.  WaitForNoteOn(),
WaitForTags(), and WaitKeyStrokeOrAppleEvent() will not run if this is set to
FALSE and MakeSound() will not wait for a "synchronized start" if FALSE. 
Answer() will return its default choice when (AEventOn && !OkWait).  This could
be a good mechanism to prevent user interaction in console/library build (??)
but notes that OkWait is also frequently reset to TRUE or 'OK' at the end of
processes.  (A console option could reenable?)


int ReadKeyBoardOn
int Jcontrol
int Interactive

ReadKeyBoardOn is set to TRUE whenever BP2 is reading Midi input as an immediate
user input source (eg. typing note names, getting the # or value of a controller
to enter into a document or dialog field(?)).

Jcontrol is the number of the performance control being read. (-1 == none)

Interactive is TRUE when the "Interactive (use input)" button is checked on the 
lower "Settings" dialog and BP2 is listening to Midi input for triggers and
parameter controllers (K1, etc.) set in the Interaction and Grammar(?) files.

When OMS was the Midi driver, ListenMIDI() would not proceed unless at least one
of ReadKeyBoardOn, Interactive, or ScriptRecOn was TRUE.  (The CoreMIDI driver
should perhaps be changed to work like the OMS one).
