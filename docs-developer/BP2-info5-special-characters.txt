Non-ASCII Character Usage in Bol Processor
==========================================

Bol Processor makes use of many special characters that were available in the 
Mac OS Roman character set.  Here are some notes to help identify these
characters in the code and to suggest how to migrate to Unicode UTF-8.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman

Note: This document is encoded using Unicode UTF-8.

in Misc.c:

MySpace(char c)
{
if(c == '\r' || c == '\n' || c == '\0') return(NO);
if(isspace(c)) return(YES);
if(c == (char) -54 || c == '\20') return(YES);	/* option space, ctrl-p */
return(NO);
}

-54 = 0xCA (202) which is a non-breaking space (in Mac Roman).
'\20' = 0x10 (16) which is the DLE (Data Link Escape) control character.

The comment notes that '\20' is also Control-P, which must have had some
other use on Mac OS? (In TextWrangler it functions like the up arrow key(?)
but only if Emacs key bindings are enabled).
