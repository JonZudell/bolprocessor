Identification protocol

When first started, BP2 creates an invisible file "_bp2_startdate" containing the
    current date.

If "_bp2_startdate" is found at startup, the current date is compared with the stored
    one.  If the trial period is expired, the user is requested to apply for a key.
    This is the only inconvenienced caused to non-registered users.

The key is a text file named "_bp2_key".
    The first time it is read, it is made invisible and "_bp2_startdate" is deleted.
    It should contain a header followed with the user name and institution.  If this
    information is missing, the user is requested to enter it, it is stored and the
    file is made invisible.

The admin can create a "_bp2_key" file as follows:
    Run BP2 beta version and type command-option-K
    Enter admin password
    Write name and institution (normally not required, will be done by user)
    Save file
    In this process the admin may also delete the current (invisible) key
