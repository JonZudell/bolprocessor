Hi Bernard,  making copies of objects -that opens new doors for
experimentations!
BTW: I get this warning in the Trace-window: 'Correction factor 1.074 might
be out of rangeSÿ'

Another suggestion (for new 'serial' tools) :

_pertubation(factor) .

This is similar to _rndtime, but pertubations randomize pitches with a
factor (more or less daviations). With the concept of recursion you can
design then evolving melodies.

_rndtransp(12,-12)

This randomize the pitches with for instance an octave above and below.
